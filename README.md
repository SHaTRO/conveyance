Node.js Express Server Framework

REST endpoints should be added as routes.  


This is work-in-progress.  
We will be reworking error handlers, router interface, configuration interface, and providing examples of middleware installation.
We will also be adding additional functionality.

The goal here is to provide a ready-built, extensible server framework based on Express.  

The framework will be complete with logging, static resource support, error handling, etc.  

Target version 1.0.x will bear the final API contract for version 1.0.   There is NO API CONTRACT for v.0.1.  

See "examples" for current API examples.
