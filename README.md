**Current Status**
First round of files to be checked in shortly.

Version 0.x of this framework is used by cloning/copying then adding your configurations and resources.

REST endpoints should be added as routes.  



**Future Direction**

Version 1.x of this framework will likely go something like this:
   npm install conveyance
   node ./node_modules/conveyance/bin/setup.js
