Node.js Express Server Framework

**Current Status**

Server is contained in "server/" directory.

Start it with "node server/main.js"

Version 0.x of this framework is used by cloning/copying then adding your configurations and resources.

REST endpoints should be added as routes.  



**Future Direction**

Version 1.x of this framework will likely go something like this:
<pre>
    $ npm install conveyance
    $ node ./node_modules/conveyance/bin/setup.js
</pre>
